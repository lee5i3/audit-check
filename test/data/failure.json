      "overview": "Affected versions of `sync-exec` use files located in `/tmp/` to buffer command results before returning values. As `/tmp/` is almost always set with world readable permissions, this may allow low privilege users on the system to read the results of commands run via `sync-exec` under a higher privilege user.",
      "recommendation": "There is currently no direct patch for `sync-exec`, as the `child_process.execSync` function provided in Node.js v0.12.0 and later provides the same functionality natively. \n\nThe best mitigation currently is to update to Node.js v0.12.0 or later, and migrate all uses of `sync-exec` to `child_process.execSync()`.\n",

      "overview": "Affected version of `qs` are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution because it is possible to bypass the protection. The `qs.parse` function fails to properly prevent an object's prototype to be altered when parsing arbitrary input. Input containing `[` or `]` may bypass the prototype pollution protection and alter the Object prototype. This allows attackers to override properties that will exist in all objects, which may lead to Denial of Service or Remote Code Execution in specific circumstances.",
